/**
 * Marks classes defining text format.
 * <p>
 * Each text format should be represented as a stand-alone class.
 * Each class should define pecularities specific for each text format.
 * Such classes should all be marked with TextFormat annotation.
 * <p>
 * There two requirements for marked class
 * <ul>
 *   <li>it should have no type variables
 *   <li>it should provide method with the following signature:
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
 *     public static Appendable createEscapingAppendable(Appendable appendable)
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 * </ul>
 *
 * An implementation of createEscapingAppendable method should decorate given appendable argument
 * to create new appendable that will escape any special characters, specific to given format.
 * <p>
 * Decorated appendable should never buffer any data.
 * Escaped text should be written to original appendable immediately.
 * <p>
 * For example, HTML implementation should escape '&amp;', '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters.
 * <p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *     Appendable htmlAppendable = Html.createEscapingAppendable(System.out);
 *     htmlAppendable.append(" if a < b & b < c then a < c ");
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * The result when running code above should be
 * <p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *  if a &lt; b &amp; b &lt; c then a &lt; c
 * }</pre>
